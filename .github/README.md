### **🦖 Triceratops - The Three-Horned Code Wrangler**  

Triceratops is a **friendly automation bot** that roams the repo, making **small but mighty code improvements** so you don’t have to. It keeps things clean, efficient, and up to date—without breaking (too many) things.  

### **🔹 What does Triceratops do?**  
- 🦕 **Formats & tidies up code** (because messy code is prehistoric).  
- 🔄 **Updates dependencies** (keeping things from going extinct).  
- ✂️ **Refactors & cleans unused bits** (fossils belong in museums, not repos).  
- 🚀 **Bumps versions** (evolution is key).  

Triceratops commits separately, so you always know when the automation strikes. No need to thank it—just keep the repo dino-friendly.

Designed to be minimalistic yet professional.

I enjoy working with README files, blending Markdown's simplicity with tools like Obsidian for knowledge management. This README was a chance to explore HTML for added stylistic flexibility, demonstrating what you can get with a GitHub profile README, without external tools.
